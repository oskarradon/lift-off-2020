          The beautiful portrait images throughot the site were shot by Kali Wellner. Kali Wallner was born in 1997 and was raised in Forest Grove, Oregon. She attended the Art institute of Portland directly after high school to pursue a commercial photography field. While she took classes, Kali built up a studio lighting practice which is based around editorial, fashion, and food photography. She also was able to photograph for the Slip Magazine Club during her attendance which included helping style shoots, collaborating with other majors to create a cohesive and unified idea, and building a seasonal magazine for two years. After the unfortunate closing of the Art Institute in 2018, Kali transferred to Pacific Northwest College of Arts where she now still attends, but is more focused on expanding her fine art and personal practice.
