# PNCA Lift Off 2020

*Lift Off is a portfolio showcase for the graduating class of PNCA's Illustration and Design programs.*

This is a static site I designed and developed as part of an internship with the Communications Department at the Pacific Northwest College of Art in Summer of 2020. It is the counterpart to a printed version that will be made available soon!
