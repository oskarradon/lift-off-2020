        <p>Tali Munning is an illustrator and designer who listens to peppy music at unhealthy volumes. She brings her original fascination with analog materials into her digital art to evoke a mixed-media style. Tali’s art is figurative in nature, often working in her interest in character design, fantasy, and fashion. Ideally, she wants to tell a story through the characters in her art.</p>

        <p class="question">
        	What do you geek out about?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Tali:</span>
          What don’t I geek out about? I love a lot of cartoons and movies and video games, too many to go into. But I guess the most “unique” thing would be leitmotifs, which are recurring musical ideas that represent a person or idea. I adore hearing those used in soundtracks, and I could analyze leitmotif-oriented music for hours if anyone were willing to listen.

        <p class="question">
        	Why do you do what you do?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Tali:</span>
          Pretty simple answer, it makes me happy. Drawing is the only thing I’ve been consistently passionate about throughout my life. The ability of an artist to take something from their head, something that no one else can see, and make it visible and tangible in the real world has always been almost akin to magic for me, and performing this act myself gives me a feeling of accomplishment like nothing else. I just love to create.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
        	What fictional/video game character would you be?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Tali:</span>
          Honestly? <a href=":https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Meta_Knight">Meta Knight</a> from <i>Kirby</i>, because he tries to look cool but is actually a huge softie. Also because Kirby was my first video game, so it holds a special place in my heart.

        <p class="question">
        	What do you collect? Or, what are you obsessed with?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Tali:</span>
          ROCKS! I collect gemstones and minerals (and the occasional fossil) and I like trying to remember all their names and how they were formed. That would probably be my largest collection, unless you count the unnecessary amount of black t-shirts I own.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
        	What advice would you give your past self?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Tali:</span>
          “Don’t worry so much about impressing people. Just do what makes you happy.”
