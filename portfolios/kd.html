        <p>KD York is a queer illustrator shaped by berry picking and daydreaming in the grown-over paths of East Portland. They use a wide range of mediums from paint to <a href="https://www.kdydraws.com/eddy">quilt squares</a>, to share feelings of nostalgia for places you’ve never been and memories you can’t quite place.</p>

        <p class="question">
        	What do you geek out about?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>KD:</span>
          This changes with the tides, everything is so interesting! But I will always talk about how pro wresting is the best form of storytelling, with anyone who will listen! It’s all the drama of theater with all the fake violence of comics! what’s not to love?
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          Why do you do what you do?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>KD:</span>
          I had a hard time expressing myself as a child. I couldn’t write or read for a very long time, so drawing became one of the few ways I could express myself in a way others could understand. And as I got older I felt it was the only way I could show who I was, in a world where it felt like no one out there was like me. So, now, I want to continue to make work to express who I am and hopefully inspire someone else to do the same.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          What’s something you like to do when you travel?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>KD:</span>
            I always say, “I'll eat anything once,” so whenever I go anywhere I always try to find the most hole-in-the-wall place to eat that I can! Good food makes better memories of a place then any knick knacks or guided tour ever could. (Though, I do love cheesy knick knacks.)
        </p>

      	<p class="question">
          What would your alter ego do, if not illustration?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>KD:</span>
          As a child I dreamed I could be the weaver of a small village who made all the rugs and blankets and told all the best stories to anyone who would listen. I don’t know what that would be called, but I’d want to be that.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          Is there anything you wish you had known when you started school, that you know now?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>KD:</span>
          Chill out with the details on that thumbnail, no one’s looking at it but you, and you’ve got 20 other things to do tonight. Also, just be a little bit kinder to yourself, you’re doing great.
