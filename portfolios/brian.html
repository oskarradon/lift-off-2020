        <p>Brian Wolfe is an illustrator that specializes in the gross and uncanny. Through juxtaposition and a gritty ink style he produces works that combine both creepy and comical elements. Brian can most often be found working on new stickers, or planning for his next D&D session.</p>

          Games. Games are so cool in so many ways that I could talk about for days. A medium that allows the author to lead an audience through an experience, but include the audience in the experience itself, is just one of the reasons why i think games are so fantastically interesting as a medium.

          <span>Brian:</span>
          I’ve long been inspired by what is traditionally referred to as “low-art.” Doodles in margins, stickers on the backs of stop signs, or full-on street art. I love art that’s put up just for the sake of display or for self expression. My mission is to find ways to “elevate” forms of art like this and give them the space I believe they deserve.

          Never stop drawing.

          <span>Brian:</span>
          Honestly? You just have to bang your head against the wall until something works. I have a small whiteboard and pen near my desk I’ll use when I’m getting severe artist’s block. The whiteboard makes it easy to hash out ideas over and over again in quick succession. Usually, after forcing myself to get all of the obvious or bad ideas out of the way, I’ll stumble upon something useful.
