      <section class="bio">
        <p>Kara La is a Vietnamese-American artist under the alias “Tura Sanze” from California. She indulges often in fantasy and elegance, the seemingly mundane details and subtle intensity of emotions that leads her interest in creating worlds and storytelling. Her roots and love in fashion design, music performance, Eastern media, and role-playing games have taken a strong influence in her work to craft and convey the wonders she often wishes reality had through concept work and illustration. She has an unhealthy adoration for ratty-looking chihuahuas.</p>

        <p class="question">
        	What do you geek out about?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Kara:</span>
          Oh gosh, I’ll have to narrow it down to skincare, Final Fantasy XIV, and glaciers. Quite the range I think. The amount of skincare products that I have and want to use; the emotional investment and game research I have put into FFXIV; and glaciers – I just think they’re neat, to the point that I researched them in middle school for Science Olympiad excessively so that I actually placed 5th at state without a partner. OK, maybe I’m bragging a little there and haven’t really ever let it go, but who would’ve thought giant chunks of ice would be interesting?! I will visit Mt. Hood’s glaciers at some point and when I do, I will immediately find my way to face plant into it. Conflicting note: I don’t like the cold.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          What would your alter ego do, if not design/illustration?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Kara:</span>
          I would probably be doing music composition or fashion design! Though if I had to stray entirely from the general idea of artsy-creative stuff, I think I’d be doing something like glaciology or biochem or some sort of applied physics – really I’d want to learn and do a bit of everything if I could…
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          What do you collect or are obsessed with?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Kara:</span>
          I like collecting various boxes that come my way, or a more general term would be storage containers I guess since I have a jar here and there, but otherwise I have a lot of boxes inside other various boxes just for the sake of having those boxes. If it’s an interesting or pretty container and I can keep it clean, I will keep it.
        </p>

      	<p class="question">
          How does design/illustration relate to other creative work that you do?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Kara:</span>
          It just happens to be the main method that I have chosen to create and express with, as I’m very much into music, fashion, storytelling, the visuals of dance (as I don’t think I’d ever be quite as agile as the dancers that I admire are), am willing to pick up into coding/programming/do the technical aspect of such creative things and larger projects, so on and so forth. Alas, I only have so much time! Perhaps as time passes I can learn these things and solo some projects at a snail’s pace, but otherwise I would love a collaborative environment to incorporate it all together at a comparatively faster rate, which is where my interest in entertainment media comes.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          Why do you do what you do?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Kara:</span>
          That’s a question people ask about me in general for a variety of reasons! The answer always comes around to “because it’s fun and I’m not hurting anyone with it so why not.” I have this weird dichotomy in presentation where I’m told often I look so put together, serious to the point people say their initial impression of me is intimidating, very administrative-like, etc. so it apparently seems like everything I do is very calculated with some massive philosophy behind it – and sure I can answer something like that – but also my personality is very much fun and chill I like to think. I’m not a scary person! I just like to enjoy things for what they are, and if I’m able to make what I believe is success with it, that’s what matters in the end.
