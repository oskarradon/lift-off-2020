        <p class="question">
        	Why do you do what you do?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Julie:</span>
          I don’t talk about this too often, but the reason why I design is because of my older brother. He is a graphic designer and I was inspired by all the work he created in high school. I tried it out for myself, and grew to love it as much as he did. I was basically his shadow, and actually followed him to Oregon and went to the same college he went to. He is now working for the Portland Timbers as a graphic designer and hopefully one day I too get to reach that same goal of working at a great company.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          What is one thing you want to learn right now?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Julie:</span>
          I really want to learn embroidery! I love tedious, hands-on tasks and something about it seems very therapeutic.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          What advice would you give your past self?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Julie:</span>
          Hey girl, don’t be so hard on yourself. No one is perfect and it’s okay to give yourself a break every now and then. There will be times when you feel overwhelmed with things but take deep breaths and tackle it one step at a time.
        </p>

      	<p class="question">
          Sweet or salty? Cake or pie? Coffee/tea?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Julie:</span>
          Sweet, Cake, and Bubble tea!
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          What would your alterego do, if not design/illustration?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Julie:</span>
          When I was little, I wanted to be a massage therapist. I believed that I had “healing powers” and would practice on my parents everyday (haha)! So if I wasn’t a designer, I think I’d be a masseuse or maybe take on some other profession in the health field.
