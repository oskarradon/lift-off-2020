        <p class="question">
        	Is there anything you wish you had known when you started school, that you know now?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Megan:</span>
          I wish I knew the point of school wasn’t to make perfect work all the time and make things to please other people. I wish I had started to ask myself what I wanted to do earlier, instead of doing what I thought others wanted.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          What would your alter ego do, if not design/illustration?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Megan:</span>
          I absolutely love caring for dogs and teaching kids art, so if I could create a hybrid dog shelter/art camp, I’d be in heaven.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          If you could go anywhere and draw, where would you go?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Megan:</span>
          I love hiking through mossy old-growth forests, and would love to explore more of Oregon and draw the native flora and fauna.
        </p>

      	<p class="question">
          Why do you do what you do?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Megan:</span>
          I create artwork referencing what it is like to be a lesbian because I desperately needed it when I was younger. By showing unapologetic displays of Sapphic love, hopefully it becomes more acceptable and normalized for those outside the community, and is empowering for young people struggling to find themselves. I also strongly believe in the healing power of art and expressing myself through my work.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          What do you collect? Or, what are you obsessed with?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Megan:</span>
          I have a rock collection I started in childhood that is still expanding – I grew up collecting thundereggs and agates in Eastern Oregon and have been fascinated by rocks of all kinds ever since. something useful.
